Hey, I'm Jan 👋

PM at Snowflake building developer tools and improving DX.

I write code (TypeScript, Python, SQL) to prototype ideas and ship features.

Previously built LLM-powered translation quality systems, data pipelines, and B2B SaaS products.

Writing about what I'm building on [Substack](https://realproductwork.substack.com).
