Hey, I'm Jan 👋

Technical PM at Localazy building AI translation quality tools. I write code (TypeScript, Python, SQL) to prototype and ship product features.

**What I'm building:**

-LLM-based translation quality assessment (Accuracy, Consistency, Precision, Fluency)
-Data pipelines: BigQuery, dbt, product analytics
-Developer tools, APIs, payment systems

**Stack:**

Product: Vue 3, TypeScript, Node.js
Data: dbt, BigQuery, Metabase, Python
AI: LLM APIs, Langfuse, Vitest
